  <p>Air travel has become a regular mode of transportation for millions of people. But flying can be difficult and dangerous if the pilot cannot control the plane&rsquo;s movement in the sky. The forces of air turbulence create significant discomfort for passengers, as well as damage to aircraft components. To minimize the effects of turbulence, airlines employ a variety of tactics and tools to help pilots safely navigate their flights.
A plane&rsquo;s movement is dictated by the rotation of its propellers and engine thrust. Both of these factors help counteract the strong forces of air turbulence. Additionally, pilots use banks and turns to direct their flights and avoid dangerous obstacles in the air. These maneuvers are called &lsquo;aileron turns&rsquo; and are designed to throw a plane&rsquo;s trajectory into different directions to counteract the effects of turbulence. Even small banks and turns can make a huge difference when trying to avoid strong winds.
The force of air turbulence can be particularly severe for passengers in forward-facing seats. This is because the pressure from air against the plane&rsquo;s fuselage causes discomfort for those onboard. Airlines provide detachable oxygen masks for just this purpose. These masks are mounted near each row of seats so passengers can freely access supplemental oxygen while they are out of their seats. Additionally, crew members monitor each plane&rsquo;s condition before allowing takeoffs and landings. If weather conditions are particularly turbulent, crews may deactivate certain engines or propellers to reduce the risk of damage.
Airlines teach their pilots how to cope with turbulence by preparing in advance. They also provide training for their crew members so they can perform effective maneuvers in flight. Pilots learn how to counter the disorienting effects of turbulence by staying calm, restful, and focused during stressful situations. They also practice what to do if they or other crew members become ill during a flight. This training minimizes the risk of damage when an airline crew member becomes mentally or physically fatigued during a flight.
Applying tactics such as banks and oxygen masks helps airline passengers cope with uncomfortable conditions during flights. Plus, experienced crew members know how to help newbies understand and avoid dangerous situations on aircrafts. Ultimately, learning how to safely enjoy the wonders of aviation is much easier with proper preparation and training!</p>
